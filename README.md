# Library
This project creates a simple book library application that allows users to:
- **Add new books:** Users can input book details (title, author, pages, read status) into a form and add them to the library.
- **View book details:** The library displays a list of books with their information.
- **Mark books as read:** Users can toggle the read status of individual books.
- **Remove books:** Users can remove books from the library.
